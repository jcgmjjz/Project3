      <h2 id="professional">Professional:</h2>
      <p id="first-paragraph">Although I have an advanced degree in Electrical Engineering, I have been working as a computer engineer for most of my career. In that capacity I have acquired skills in the following areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Software design/product development</li>
        <li>Analysis and debugging</li>
        <li>Product support</li>
        <li>Software Quality Assurance</li>
        <li>Vendor management</li>
        <li>Data collection and test automation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Much of my programing skills and knowledge of real time operating systems has been self taught and are primarily C/C++ based; however, I do have Java programming skills, as well as experience with scripting languages for data collection and test automation (UNIX shell, Perl, Expect). Early in my career I was given the task of modifying a real time operating system written for an 8 bit micro-processor. Throughout my career I have demonstrated the ability to quickly acquire skills with other technologies, programming languages and processes as needed.</p>
      <p>My software dvelopment experience spans all phases of the <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm">SDLC</a> including software architecture, requirements, design, coding and testing through system level as well as product support in large distributed systems in the telecommunications domain. This includes some exposure to a cloud based Radio Network Controller product running on commercial hardware. The products I have developed were done using UNIX/Linux based development tools.</p>

      <p>All of my development experience has been in a team environment where collaboration with other team members and communication, both written and verbal, is a key to success. The software for these products is developed by a team of engineers over many years with each software release adding new functionality. In many cases I have served as a technical leader of a team of 3 to 8 engineers delivering a feature to a new release. I also have experience as a <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4363/software-quality-assurance-sqa">SQA </a> Engineer and in that capacity managed several vendors’ compliance with wireless industry standards.</p>
      <p>Recently, I have been doing performance analysis and maintenance of a live wireless network for a large carrier. This is done by analyzing the trends of Key Performance Indicators and counters to identify failing scenarios. These indicators help to isolate the failure to a network component and direct software developers to provide a fix. In this capacity I have served as an incident manager facing the customer and interfacing with software development teams.</p>
      <p>Due to the emergence of <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/internet_of_things.html">IoT</a>, technology I am currently updating my skills to include web development (both front end and back end). This link to my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> describes my professional experience.</p>
      <h2 id="personal">Personal:</h2>
      <p>I enjoy camping, hiking and rock climbing. There are 2 types of climbs that I enjoy most, metal rung and chain assisted.</p>

      <p>Metal rung and ladder climbs have metal rungs or ladders embedded in the cliff face to assist the climber.</p>
      <img id="picture3" src="media/IMG_2758ChainAssisted.JPG" width="350" height="400" alt="Climer climbing wit metal ladder assist">
      <p>Chain assisted climbs have metal poles embedded in the rock face with chains strung accross them to assist the climber. A list of the national parks I have visited with some of my favorite hikes is included <a href="nationalParksVisited.html">here</a>.</p>
